Navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` , then `npm start` to build.

## AI Usage:
To build this project, I used AI to help generate data sets representing three realistic portfolio compositions. I also used AI to assist in debugging, such as identifying typos (e.g. a missing bracket). I did not use AI to assist in idea generation or coding.
